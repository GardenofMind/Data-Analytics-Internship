Title: Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Data Analytics Internship

Description: This repository contains the code and data for analyzing the loyalty program of a hypothetical company. The purpose of the analysis is to gain 
insights into user behavior, identify potential fraud, and provide recommendations for improving the program.

Code: The analysis was performed using Python 3. The code for querying the database and generating visualizations was written in a Jupyter notebook using Pandas
and Matplotlib libraries. The notebook can be run using Jupyter.

Instructions: To run the analysis, first clone the repository onto your local machine. Then, open the Jupyter notebook using your preferred 
software and run the cells in order. The visualizations will be generated within the notebook. Make sure to include all 4 csv files in your directory.
For convenience, I have also included a PDF of the Notebook in "Fetch Data Final Analysis.pdf" along with a Structured Relational Data Model that I used to organize
the CSV files under "Relational Data Model.pdf"
