Title: Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Data Analytics Internship

Code: The analysis was performed using Python 3.9.12. The code for querying the database and generating visualizations was written in a Jupyter notebook using Pandas
and Matplotlib libraries. The notebook can be run using Jupyter.

Instructions: 
  1. Clone the repository onto your local machine. 
  2. Make sure to include all 4 csv files in your directory. "brands.csv", "receipts.csv", "receipt_items.csv", "users.csv"
  3. Open the Jupyter notebook "FETCH.ipynb" using your preferred software and run the cells in order. The visualizations will be generated within the notebook. 
  
For convenience, I have also included a PDF of the Notebook in "Fetch Data Final Analysis.pdf" along with a Structured Relational Data Model that I used to organize
the CSV files under "Relational Data Model.pdf"
